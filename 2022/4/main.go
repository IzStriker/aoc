Dear Ana,

I am writing to inform you that I am resigning from my position as Crew Trainer at McDonalds. I have decided to leave because I do not want to work over the Christmas holiday.

I have greatly enjoyed working with you and the team at McDonalds, and I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences I have had here. I am proud of the work we have done together, and I am confident that the team will continue to be successful in the future.

Before I go, I would like to know more about the resignation process. Could you please let me know what steps I need to take to ensure that my departure is handled smoothly and professionally?

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
Isaac George
